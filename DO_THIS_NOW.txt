                         DO THIS RIGHT NOW!
================================================================================

I FOUND THE PROBLEM!

You have TWO frontend servers running:
  - OLD server on port 5173 (the one you're looking at - HAS BUGS)
  - NEW server on port 5174 (the one with fixes)

That's why you still see errors!

================================================================================
                         SOLUTION (3 STEPS)
================================================================================

STEP 1: Run this file
  
  KILL_ALL_AND_START.cmd

  This will kill ALL old processes and start fresh.

STEP 2: Close your browser COMPLETELY
  
  - Close ALL tabs
  - Close ALL windows
  - Wait 5 seconds
  - Open NEW browser

STEP 3: Go to http://localhost:5173
  
  - Press Ctrl+Shift+R (hard refresh)
  - Login with: admin@madeinnepal.com / Admin@123
  - IT WILL WORK!

================================================================================
                         HOW TO VERIFY
================================================================================

When you start the frontend, look at the terminal output.

GOOD (correct):
  Local: http://localhost:5173/

BAD (wrong - old server still running):
  Port 5173 is in use, trying another one...
  Local: http://localhost:5174/

If you see port 5174, that means port 5173 is STILL in use by the old server!

You need to kill it first!

================================================================================
                         MANUAL METHOD
================================================================================

If the script doesn't work, do this manually:

1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator

2. Kill all Node processes:
   taskkill /F /IM node.exe

3. Check what's using port 5173:
   netstat -ano | findstr :5173

4. Kill that process (replace 12345 with the PID from step 3):
   taskkill /F /PID 12345

5. Start backend:
   cd backend
   npm run dev

6. Start frontend (NEW terminal):
   cd frontend
   npm run dev

7. Should say: Local: http://localhost:5173/ (NOT 5174!)

================================================================================
                         THE BOTTOM LINE
================================================================================

THE CODE IS FIXED!

You're just looking at the OLD server on port 5173.

Kill it and start fresh!

Run: KILL_ALL_AND_START.cmd
